                    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                    <p>Many leading period tracker apps present users with an overwhelming number of symptom options, questions, and features. While intended to be comprehensive, this excess of information often causes cognitive overload, making it difficult for users to focus on what truly matters to them. As a result, users may feel anxious, unsure of where to start, or abandon tracking altogether due to decision fatigue and interface clutter.</p>

      <h2 class="underlined-title">Takeaways</h2>
      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <p>Having an app with so many features and functionalities can make it difficult to display without taking away necessary information. I learned the importance of finding a balance between comprehensive features and intuitive design. It involves identifying redundancies, minimizing unnecessary elements, and presenting information in a clear and concise manner for the user.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <ul>
        <li>Understanding user needs and preferences is crucial for creating a successful product.</li>
        <li>Collaboration and communication within the team are essential for achieving project goals.</li>
        <li>Iterative design and testing help identify and address usability issues early in the process.</li>
        <li>Agile methodology allows for flexibility and adaptability in the design process.</li>
          </ul>
      <!-- <p>
        My knowlodge of software engineering helped me with my design
        strategy, as I understand some technical limitations.
      </p> -->
      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct further user testing to gather feedback on the MVP.</li>
        <li>Refine the design based on user feedback and testing results.</li>
        <li>Continue collaborating with the development team to ensure a smooth implementation of the final product.</li>
        <li>Plan for future updates and features based on user needs and market trends.</li>
