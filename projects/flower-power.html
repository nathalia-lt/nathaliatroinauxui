            <p>
              Many people want to buy quality flowers but don’t have much time
              to go to a flower shop. Also, some of them don’t know which flower
              is the best option for the occasion. Flower selection can be
              overwhelming and lead to poor choices that end up in a wasted
              budget.

              affect users who are not sure which flower to choose by letting
              the user make a faster decision and saving their time. I will
              measure effectiveness by having different flowers categories with
              real pictures Find high-quality flowers without getting
              overwhelmed. Design easy and intuitive app with a smooth and easy
              experience for the user.

        <h3 class="underlined-title">Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          In my design process I decide to use Design thinking , a user-centered
          approach to problem-solving that includes research, prototyping and
          testing to help to understand who is my user is, what their problems
          are, and what design should include. I consider their story, emotions
          and insights I have gathered about them.

        <h3 class="underlined-title">Understanding the User</h3>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>
          To understand the needs and goals of my target users, I conduct user
          research using a combination of methods, including surveys,
          interviews, created close-up and big picture storyboards, emphaty
          maps, personas and user journey map.
        </p>

        <h4>User Interview</h4>
        <p>
          I interviewed 5 individuals, age 18 - 55, who have a busy life
          schedule.
        </p>

        <h4>User research: Pain Points</h4>
        <img
          class="painpoints"
          src="../assets/painpoint-container.png"
          alt="user-painpoint"
        />

        <!-- Define -->
        <div class="define">
          <h4>Personas</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the information gotten from my interviews, I was able to
            create these two personas to represent the larger user group
          </p>
          <div class="container-personas">
            <img

              alt="persona2"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Defining the problem statment</h3>
          <p>
            After gathering the findings from the research, I define the problem
            statement.
          </p>
          <h4>Problem Statment</h4>
          <p>
            Emily Hacker is a full time student who needs to choose the right
            bouquet to send as a gift for the right occasion, because she has a
            busy schedule and no time to go to a flower store. What are the
            feautures necessary to help to make a decision
          </p>

          <h4>User Journey map</h4>
          <p>I created a user journey, to see how my user feel.</p>
          <img
            class="user-journey"
            src="../assets/userJourney.png"

          alt="horizontal-line"
        />
        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
          Creating the paper wireframe allowed me to synthesize initial
          information gathered from prospective users
        </p>
        <img class="wireframe" src="../assets/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe" />
        <h4>Lo-fi wireframes</h4>
        <p>
          The first version of lo-fi wireframes allowed me to run early
          usability tests and discover the priority revisions that need to be
          implemented.
        </p>
        <p>The version below includes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a list of recommended bouquets</li>
          <li>Improved the navigation bar with a search option</li>
