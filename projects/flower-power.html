              Many people want to buy quality flowers but don’t have much time
              to go to a flower shop. Also, some of them don’t know which flower
              is the best option for the occasion. Flower selection can be
              overwhelming and lead to poor choices that end up in a wasted
              budget.

              the user make a faster decision and saving their time. I will
              measure effectiveness by having different flowers categories with
              real pictures Find high-quality flowers without getting
              overwhelmed. Design easy and intuitive app with a smooth and easy
              experience for the user.

      <section class="design-process">
        <h2 class="underlined-title">Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          In my design process I decide to use Design thinking , a user-centered
          approach to problem-solving that includes research, prototyping and
          testing to help to understand who is my user is, what their problems
          are, and what design should include. I consider their story, emotions
          and insights I have gathered about them.

      <!-- Understanding the user -->

        <h2 class="underlined-title">Understanding the User</h2>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          To understand the needs and goals of my target users, I conduct user
          research using a combination of methods, including surveys,
          interviews, created close-up and big picture storyboards, emphaty
          maps, personas and user journey map.
        </p>

        <h3>User Interview</h3>
        <p>User interviews help uncover the user's needs, goals and frustations, revealing their pain points</p>
        <p>
          I interviewed 5 individuals, age 18 - 55, who have a busy life
          schedule.
        </p>

        <h3>User research: Pain Points</h3>

        <div class="define">
          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>
            Based on research findings, I created a persona who represents the target user of the flower app and their needs and habits. This helped me to empathize with the end user on the remaining steps of the design process.
          </p>

          </div>
          <h3>Defining the problem statment</h3>
          <p>
            After gathering the findings from the research, I define the problem
            statement.
          </p>
          <h4>Problem Statment:</h4>
          <p>

            Emily Hacker is a full time student who needs to choose the right
            bouquet to send as a gift for the right occasion, because she has a
            busy schedule and no time to go to a flower store. What are the
            feautures necessary to help to make a decision

          <h3>User Journey map</h3>
          <p>I created a user journey, to see how my user feel.</p>

            <p>I created a user flow for the payment process, that is one of the most important functionality. Task flow assumes a visit by a guest who hasn't sign up yet.</p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          Creating the paper wireframe allowed me to synthesize initial
          information gathered from prospective users
        </p>
        <img class="wireframe" src="../assets/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe" />
        <h3>Lo-fi wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          After defining the main user flow, I attempted to create the first set of lo-fi wireframes to run some preliminary testing with the actual users. That allowed me to gather some initial feedback and save time later in the process before I started the high-fidelity prototype.
        </p>
        <p>The version below includes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a list of recommended bouquets</li>
          <li>Improved the navigation bar with a search option</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Systems</h3>
        <p>My goal was to keep the elements I was designing cohesive with the developed branding. I created a simple set of icons, buttons and a color palette using the colors of the logo. I wanted this website to represent......</p>

        <p>Based on the feedback from usability test, helped guide the design from low-fidelity wireframes to the mockups and high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
        <p>User test revealed a list of priority revisions that I implemented to the high-fidelity prototype that included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users want to be able to favorited the bouquet for further purchase</li>
            <li>Users want to read the reviews to make sure of their choice</li>
            <li>Users find it easier to have the search bar on the main page</li>

            <p class="gif-description">For Home screen, I added some slide hero image to get the user attention for the rewards and disconts also move the search bar to the top of the screen, divide the categories with a slide options and add you might also like section.</p>

      <!-- Takeaways -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="underlined-title">Takeaways</h2>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>The app has been described by usability study participants as easy to use, easy to navigate and intuitive.</p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>Trust the design process to let go of biases: I designed the flower app as a part of google UX design certification. I was too certain about what my app would include, from the very beggining. The interviews, survey, competitive analysis proved me wrong early in the process. Research is insightful and one of the things I would like to learn more about.</p>
        <p>Also, my knowlodge in software engineering helped me with my design strategy, as I understand some technical limitations.</p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct a separate Usability Study on a different set of participants to see if the design changes are viewed as valuable to a wider audience.</li>
            <li>Create a Scalable Design System to ensure consistency and seamless knowledge sharing if collaboration or the need to design more screens arises.</li>
