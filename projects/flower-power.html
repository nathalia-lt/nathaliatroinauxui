            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>
              Flower mobile app is an e-commerce designed for people interested
              in flowers as a gift or decoration. Farm Flower will help the user
              to find the most suitable flower and get them deliveried

            <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>
              Many people want to buy quality flowers but don’t have much time
              to go to the florist. Also, some of them don’t know which flower
              is the best option for the occasion. Flower selection can be
              overwhelming and lead to poor choices that end up in a wasted
              budget.

            <h3>GOAL</h3>
            <p>
              Flower app will let users order flowers by filter through
              categories which will affect users who are not sure which flower
              to choose by letting the user make a faster decision and saving
              their time. I would measure effectiveness by analyzing the number
              of orders and sign-ups. Design easy and intuitive app with a
              smooth and easy experience for the user.

        <p>
          In my design process I decide to use Design thinking, a user-centered
          approach to problem-solving that includes research, prototyping and
          testing to help to understand who is my user is, what their problems
          are, and what design should include. I consider their story, emotions
          and insights I have gathered about them.

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          To understand the needs and goals of my target users, I conduct user
          research using a combination of methods, including surveys,
          interviews, created close-up and big picture storyboards, emphaty
          maps, personas and user journey map.
        </p>

        <h3>User Interview</h3>
        <p>
          User interviews help uncover the user's needs, goals and frustations,
          revealing their pain points
        </p>
        <p>
          I interviewed 5 individuals, age 18 - 55, who have a busy life
          schedule.

            During the interviews I noticed that users like to check the update
            of their purchase, what helps people with anxiety. I also added a

            options.

      <!-- Takeaways -->

        <h2 class="underlined-title">Takeaways</h2>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The app has been described by usability study participants as easy to
          use, easy to navigate and intuitive.
        </p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          Trust the design process to let go of biases: I designed the flower
          app as a part of google UX design certification. I was too certain
          about what my app would include, from the very beggining. The
          interviews, survey, competitive analysis proved me wrong early in the
          process. Research is insightful and one of the things I would like to
          learn more about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, my knowlodge in software engineering helped me with my design
          strategy, as I understand some technical limitations.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conduct a separate Usability Study on a different set of
            participants to see if the design changes are viewed as valuable to
            a wider audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the design system more detailed
          </li>
        </ul>
