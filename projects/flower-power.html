        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          In order to understand the needs and goals of my target users, I conducted a mix of qualitative and quantitative
          research using a combination of methods, including surveys,
          interviews.
        </p>

        <h3>User Interview</h3>
        <p>
          User interviews help uncover the user's needs, goals and frustations,
          revealing their pain points.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I interviewed 5 individuals, who are frequent flower buyers, occasional buyers, gift givers and Event planners.
        </p>

            Based on research findings, I created two user personas who represents the target user of the flower app and their needs and habits. This helped me to empathize with the end user on the remaining steps of the design process.

            <p>HMW statements address the mais pain points and opportunites identified in Ann Goular journey.</p>
            <p>The plan is to generate as many as questions to validate and find out insights.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How might we simplify the navigation and layout of the Flower app to make it more intuitive and user-friendly?</li>
              <li>How might we provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and past purchases?</li>
              <li>How might we enhance the product information with detailed descriptions, high-quality images?</li>
              <li>How might we streamline the customization and checkout process to reduce steps and improve usability?</li>
            </ul>



          
          <h3>User Journey map</h3>
          <p>I created a user journey, to see how my user feels.</p>

She values convenience and efficiency, often making purchases through her smartphone during breaks at work or while commuting. Recently, Ann heard about Fiori app from a friend and saw several ads on social media. Intrigued by the promise of a seamless flower-buying experience, she decides to give it a try.

          users. That allowed me to gather some initial feedback and save time
          later in the process before I started the high-fidelity prototype.

      <!-- Takeaways -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="underlined-title">Takeaways</h2>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The app has been described by usability study participants as easy to
          use, easy to navigate and intuitive. Real-time updates keep customer informed, reduced anxiety and increased satisfation. Also user could quickly find and purchase flowers and related products, saving time and effort.
        </p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          Trust the design process to let go of biases: I designed the flower
          app as a part of google UX design certification. I was confident
          that my app included all the necessary feature set, from the very beginning. The interviews, surveys, competitive analysis proved me wrong early in the
          process. Research is insightful and one of the things I would like to
          learn more about.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conduct a separate Usability Study on a different set of
            participants to see if the design changes are viewed as valuable to
            a wider audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the design system more detailed
          </li>
        </ul>
