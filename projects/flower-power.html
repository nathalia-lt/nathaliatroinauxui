                        <p>Many people want to buy quality flowers but don’t have much time to go to a flower shop. Also, some of them don’t know which flower is the best option for the occasion. Flower selection can be overwhelming and lead to poor choices that end up in a wasted budget.

                        <p>GOAL</p>
                        <p>Flower will let users search flowers by categories which will affect users who are not sure which flower to choose by letting the user make a faster decision and saving their time. I will measure effectiveness by having different flowers categories with real pictures Find high-quality flowers without getting overwhelmed. Design easy and intuitive app with a smooth and easy experience for the user.</p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <img class="horizontal-line" src="../assets/horizontal-line.svg" alt="horizontal-line">
                <p>
                    In my design process I decide to use Design thinking , a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes research, prototyping and testing to help to understand who is my user is, what their problems are,  and what design should include. I consider their story, emotions and insights I have gathered about them.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding the User</h3>

                    <p>
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>To understand the needs and goals of my target users, I conduct user research using a combination of methods, including surveys, interviews, created close-up and big picture storyboards, emphaty maps, personas and user journey map.</p>

                    <h4>User Interview</h4>
                    <p>I interviewed 5 individuals, age  18 - 55,  who have a busy life schedule.</p>

                    <h4>User research: Pain Points</h4>

            <section class="define">
                <h4>Personas</h4>
                <p>Based on the information gotten from my interviews, I was able to create these two personas to represent the larger user group</p>
                <div class="container-persons">

                <h3>Defining the problem statment</h3>
                <p>After gathering the findings from the research, I  define the problem statement.</p>
                <h4>Problem Statment</h4>
                <p>Emily Hacker is a full time student who needs to choose the right bouquet to send as a gift for the right occasion, because she has a busy schedule and no time to go to a flower store. What are the feautures necessary to help to make a decision</p>
            
                <h4>User Journey map</h4>
                <p>I created a user journey, to see how my user feel.</p>

                <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                <p>Creating the paper wireframe allowed me to synthesize initial information gathered from prospective users</p>
                <img class="wireframe" src="../assets/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe">
                <h4>Lo-fi wireframes</h4>
                <p>The first version of lo-fi wireframes allowed me to run early usability tests and discover the priority revisions that need to be implemented.</p>
                <p>The version below includes </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a list of recommended bouquets</li>
                    <li>Improved the navigation bar with a search option</li>
