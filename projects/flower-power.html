            <p>
              Fiori is an e-commerce mobile app designed for people interested in flowers as a gift or decoration. The app will help the user to find the most suitable flowers and get them delivered.

            <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>
              Many people want to buy quality flowers but don’t have much time
              to go to the florist. Also, some of them don’t know which flower
              is the best option for the occasion. Flower selection can be
              overwhelming and lead to poor choices that end up in a wasted
              budget.

            <h3>GOAL</h3>
            <p>
              Fiori provides an intuitive user interface that allows customers to browse for different flowers in a very informed and customizable way. The search bar as well as different categories allow users to quickly find what they are looking for in a time efficient manner. The intuitive design as well as the friendly colos scheme keeps users engaged and happy. 
              Effectiveness is measured by analyzing the number
              of orders and sign-ups completed through the app as well as user feedback through the app store.

        <p>
          In my design process I decided to use Design thinking, a user-centered
          approach to problem-solving that includes research, prototyping and
          testing which helps me understand who my user is, what their problems
          are, and what design should I include. The design considers their stories, emotions
          and insights which I have gathered about them thorughout my design process.

        <h2 class="underlined-title">Understanding the User</h2>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          In order to understand the needs and goals of my target users, I conducted user
          research using a combination of methods, including surveys,
          interviews, emphaty maps, personas and user journey map.
        </p>

        <h3>User Interview</h3>
        <p>
          User interviews help uncover the user's needs, goals and frustations,
          revealing their pain points.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I interviewed 5 individuals, age 18 - 55, who have a busy life
          schedule and have ordered online flowers.

            For Home screen, I added some slides hero image to get the user
            attention for the rewards and discounts. I also moved the search bar to the top of the screen, I used tabs to group content into helpful categories and added you might also like section.

            During the interviews I noticed that users like to check the update
            of their purchase, that helps people reduce their anxiety. I also added a CTA to encourage the user to navigate through other bouquet
            options.

      <!-- Takeaways -->

        <h2 class="underlined-title">Takeaways</h2>
        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The app has been described by usability study participants as easy to
          use, easy to navigate and intuitive.
        </p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          Trust the design process to let go of biases: I designed the flower
          app as a part of google UX design certification. I was confident
          that my app included all the necessary feature set, from the very beginning. The interviews, surveys, competitive analysis proved me wrong early in the
          process. Research is insightful and one of the things I would like to
          learn more about.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My knowlodge of software engineering helped me with my design
          strategy, as I understand some technical limitations.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conduct a separate Usability Study on a different set of
            participants to see if the design changes are viewed as valuable to
            a wider audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the design system more detailed
          </li>
