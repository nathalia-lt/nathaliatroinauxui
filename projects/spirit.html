                    <p>Spirit Airlines aims to provide affordable air travel with a user-friendly digital experience. While the app performs reasonably well, there are opportunities for improvement, particularly in areas like flight selection, fee transparency, and personalization. Addressing these aspects could further enhance customer satisfaction and trip planning efficiency.</p>

                    On the airport flight page, the search bar was originally labeled “From where?” After observing that a user who had never flown before was confused about whether to search for a city or an airport, I updated the label to “Search for airport, city, or address” to make it clearer. I also improved the prompt for enabling location services and added features that show how far the airport is from the user’s current location, along with an estimated travel time to get there.

                    Displaying the trip duration provides users with immediate feedback about the length of their stay, reducing cognitive load. This is especially helpful for users who may not be consciously aware of how many days their trip spans when selecting departure and return dates. Users can quickly adjust their dates to match their desired trip length without having to mentally calculate the duration. This streamlines the booking process and minimizes errors, such as accidentally selecting an overly long or short trip.<strong>"I loved the trip duration feature, I wish Airbnb had it"</strong> 3P. </p>

        <h2>A/B Testing Plan</h2>
        <p>To ensure our redesign truly met users’ needs, I created an A/B testing data-driven approach that lets real users guide our next steps. By comparing the original and updated versions side by side, I would set out to discover which design delivered a smoother, more intuitive experience. </p>

              <p>Does highlighting key information reduce the time users take to complete a booking?</p>
              <p>Can users recall the key details of their booking (e.g., flight time, baggage) without revisiting previous steps?</p>

                         <p>Mitigation:
                        Increase the data sample to something larger in order to attempt to capture more scenarios but within the allocated budget.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>As part of the end-to-end process, I began developing the project using JavaScript and React, integrating the Amadeus API to support real-time travel data features. While the build is still in progress, the code is available for review on my <a href="https://github.com/nathalia-lt/airline-project" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, offering a closer look at my technical approach and front-end implementation.</p>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
                <p><strong>Completion Rare:</strong> Indicating a successful booking process.</p>
                <p><strong>User Satisfaction:</strong> Higher satisfaction scores in post-booking surveys.</p>
                <p><strong>Reduced Drop-off Rates:</strong> Fewer users abandoning the booking process midway.</p>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Card sorting exercise helped reveal how users expect content to be structured.</li>
                        <li>Users need better visibility of their past selections, reinforcing Jakob’s Law (users expect consistency).</li>
                        <li>How small design changes can greatly improve decision-making clarity.</li>
                        <li>How unclear labels (e.g., search bar confusion) can lead to usability issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                <!-- <p>
                  My knowlodge of software engineering helped me with my design
                  strategy, as I understand some technical limitations.
                </p> -->
                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use A/B testing (if possible) to compare the original vs. revised flow.</li>
                  <li>If I am working with stakeholders, summarize findings in a clear UX report to advocate for changes.</li>
                </ul>
