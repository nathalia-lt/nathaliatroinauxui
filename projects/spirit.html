                    <p>Spirit Airlines aims to provide affordable air travel with a user-friendly digital experience. While the app performs reasonably well, there are opportunities for improvement, particularly in areas like flight selection, fee transparency, and personalization. Addressing these aspects could further enhance customer satisfaction and trip planning efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
        <p>To truly understand what users experience, I conducted in-depth research using multiple methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heuristic Analysis: Evaluated the current Spirit Airlines app against usability principles.</li>
            <li>Jobs To Be Done (JTBD): Identified user goals and tasks to inform design decisions.</li>
            <li>Card Sorting: Organized content and features based on user expectations.</li>
            <li>Competitive Analysis: Analyzed competitors like JetBlue and booking.com to identify best practices and gaps.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>User Interviews:</h3>
        <p> Conducted qualitative interviews with 10 participants to uncover real pain points and needs.</p>

                <!-- <a href="http://">Go here to see the full hi-fi prototype</a> -->
                <p>After 2 rounds of usability testing, I created a high-fidelity prototype that incorporated the feedback and insights gathered from the previous rounds. The goal was to ensure that the design not only met user needs but also provided a seamless and intuitive experience.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the key findings from the usability testing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having a visual layout of the airplane during seat selection helped users make decisions, as it allowed them to see the exact location of the seats within the aircraft.</li>
                    <li>Highlighting key information in search results significantly improved users' ability to make informed decisions quickly.</li>
                    <li>Users appreciated the streamlined booking process, which reduced cognitive load and made it easier to navigate.</li>

                    On the airport flight page, the search bar was originally labeled “From where?” After observing that a user who had never flown before was confused about whether to search for a city or an airport, I updated the label to “Search for airport, city, or address” to make it clearer. I also improved the prompt for enabling location services and added features that show how far the airport is from the user’s current location, along with an estimated travel time to get there.

                    Displaying the trip duration provides users with immediate feedback about the length of their stay, reducing cognitive load. This is especially helpful for users who may not be consciously aware of how many days their trip spans when selecting departure and return dates. Users can quickly adjust their dates to match their desired trip length without having to mentally calculate the duration. This streamlines the booking process and minimizes errors, such as accidentally selecting an overly long or short trip.<strong>"I loved the trip duration feature, I wish Airbnb had it"</strong> 3P. </p>

                    <p>Risk:
                        There wont be a wide enough variety of issues for the users testing the app to get meaningful data for all features.</p>
                         <p>Mitigation:
                        Increase the data sample to something larger in order to attempt to capture more scenarios but within the allocated budget.</p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Usability testing revealed significantly higher user satisfaction, with participants praising the new flow for its clarity and ease of use.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Card sorting exercise helped reveal how users expect content to be structured.</li>
                        <li>Users need better visibility of their past selections, reinforcing Jakob’s Law (users expect consistency).</li>
                        <li>How small design changes can greatly improve decision-making clarity.</li>
                        <li>How unclear labels (e.g., search bar confusion) can lead to usability issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                <!-- <p>
                  My knowlodge of software engineering helped me with my design
                  strategy, as I understand some technical limitations.
                </p> -->
                <h3>Next steps</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use A/B testing (if possible) to compare the original vs. revised flow.</li>
                  <li>If I am working with stakeholders, summarize findings in a clear UX report to advocate for changes.</li>
                </ul>
