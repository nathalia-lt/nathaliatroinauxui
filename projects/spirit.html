        <!-- <h6>Project Context</h6> -->
        <p>Spirit Airlines aims to provide affordable air travel with a user-friendly digital experience. While the app performs reasonably well, there are opportunities for improvement, particularly in areas like flight selection, fee transparency, and personalization. Addressing these aspects could further enhance customer satisfaction and trip planning efficiency.</p>
      </div>  
       <div class="project-description">
        <p>This case study aims to enhance Spirit Airlines’ booking experience by creating a seamless, user-friendly journey from flight selection to payment. By focusing on clarity, accessibility, and transparency, the overhaul addresses common user pain points and aligns with business goals of increasing conversions, reducing customer service queries, and fostering loyalty. The result will be a streamlined process balancing affordability with convenience, boosting customer satisfaction and operational success.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
        <p>To truly understand what users experience, I conducted in-depth research using multiple methods:</p>
        
        <li>Desk Research: Analyzed industry trends and common pain points.</li>
        <li>competitive Analysis: Comparece Spirit app aginst competitors like JetBlue, booking.com...</li>
        <li>Survay: Gathered insights on frustations, expectations and booking behaviors.</li>
        <li>User Interview: Uncovered real pains points.</li>
        <h4>Key insights:</h4>

            <div class="data">
              <h4>30%</h4>
              <p>Struggle to to locate certain options or features on an Airline platform.</p>

            <div class="data">
              <h4>30%</h4>
              <p>Find it somewhat unclear pricing details when booking a flight.</p>

        <h2>Defining the solution</h2>
        <p>Armed with research, I synthesized findings using: Heuristic Analysis, JTBD and HMW Statements.</p>
        <h4>How might we improve Spirit Airlines’ booking experience to increase conversions while maintaining the affordability that defines the brand?</h4>
        <p>To prioritize improvements, I used:</p>
        <ul>Imapct vs. Benefit Matrix to focus on the high-value, low effort fixes first.</ul>
        <ul>MoSCoW Method to define must-haves vs. nice-tohave features</ul>
        <div class="method-wrapper">
            <img class="matrix" src="../assets/matrix-spirit.png" alt="Impact vs Benefit Matrix">

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Hypothesis Statements</h4>
            <p>I wanted to ground my ideas in evidence and ensure my approach is measurable. Here some of them:</p>
            <div class="hs-wrapper">
                <div class="hs">
                    <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                    <p>We believe that <strong>enhancig fee transparency</strong> by clearly displaying all costs upfront will result in greater trust and <strong>fewer booking drop-off</strong> because we know hidden fees are a significant deterrent, and users are more likely to complete purchases when they feel informed and in control.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="hs">
                    <h5>Desk Research</h5>
                    <p>Additional fees were also a through-line among reviews particularly for seat selection, baggage and personal items making the cost much higher than anticipated.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="hs">
                    <h5>Metrics</h5>
                    <p>Booking Drop-offs: Track the drop-off rate during the booking process to see if it decreases.
                    Completion Rate: Measure the increase in completed bookings.</p>

                    <div class="hs">
                        <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                        <p>We believe that highlighting <strong>key information in search results</strong> based on user priorities will result in improve <strong>decision-making</strong> efficiency because users often face high cognitive load of information and benefit from being able to identify essential details at a glance..</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="hs">
                        <h5>User Interview</h5>
                        <p> <strong> “I mainly look for price, flight duration, and layovers.</strong> if your app can highlight the best options based on these criteria right from the start, it would streamline my decision-making process."</p>

                    <div class="hs">

        <h2>Structuring the experience</h2>
        <p>Creating a CJM provides insights into the user's journey with the product, helping identify pain points, areas for improvement, and opportunities to enhance the overall user experience. I also include the front-door experience in my CJM to analyze the crucial entry points where users first interact with the product, ensuring their initial impressions are seamless, engaging, and set the stage for the rest of their journey.</p>

                <p>Ann Gullar, has been planning to visit her family in Miami for her mother's birthday next month. As a young professional on a tight budget, she's heard about Spirit Airlines' low-cost options but is cautious about additional fees.

        <h2>Testing & Validation</h2>
        <p>To ensure the redesign met user needs, I conducted:</p>
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>

        <h4>A/B Testing Plan:</h4>
        <div class="data-wrapper">
            <div class="data">
              <h4>Problem statement 🔎</h4>
              <p>Does highlighting key information reduce the time users take to complete a booking?</p>
              <p>Can users recall the key details of their booking (e.g., flight time, baggage) without revisiting previous steps?</p>

            <div class="data">
              <h4>Hypothesis 💡</h4>
              <p>We believe that implementing a new design for the flight selection interface will make the booking process faster, reduce cognitive load, and lead to a higher completion rate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="data">
                <h4>Risk and Mitigation 📈 </h4>
                    <p>Risk:
                        There wont be a wide enough variety of issues for the users testing the app to get meaningful data for all features.</p>
                         <p>Mitigation:
                        Increase the data sample to something larger in order to attempt to capture more scenarios but within the allocated budget.</p>
                    </div>

                      <p>By ensure that my P-value is below 0.05.
                        There is a less than 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true.</p>
