        <p>To truly understand what users experience, I conducted in-depth research using multiple methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heuristic Analysis: Evaluated the current Spirit Airlines app against usability principles.</li>
            <li>Jobs To Be Done (JTBD): Identified user goals and tasks to inform design decisions.</li>
            <li>Card Sorting: Organized content and features based on user expectations.</li>
            <li>Competitive Analysis: Analyzed competitors like JetBlue and booking.com to identify best practices and gaps.</li>

                <p>Here are some of the key findings from the usability testing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having the visual aid help in decision-making.</li>

                    On the airport flight page, the search bar was originally labeled “From where?” After observing that a user—who had never flown before—was confused about whether to search for a city or an airport, I updated the label to “Search for airport, city, or address” to make it clearer. I also improved the prompt for enabling location services and added features that show how far the airport is from the user’s current location, along with an estimated travel time to get there.

                    Displaying the trip duration provides users with immediate feedback about the length of their stay, reducing cognitive load. This is especially helpful for users who may not be consciously aware of how many days their trip spans when selecting departure and return dates. Users can quickly adjust their dates to match their desired trip length without having to mentally calculate the duration. This streamlines the booking process and minimizes errors, such as accidentally selecting an overly long or short trip. "I loved the trip duration feature, I wish Airbnb had it"     </p>
