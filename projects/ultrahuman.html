            <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of key competitors in the health and wellness app space, categorizing them into four distinct groups. This process helped identify their strengths and uncover areas for improvement. The goal was to understand what competitors excelled at and which features could be enhanced or reimagined within the Ultrahuman experience.</p>

            <h2>Rapid User Testing and Design Interaction</h2>
            <p>To validate the proposed solutions, I created interactive prototypes and conducted rapid user testing sessions with 5 participants. The main objective was to identify any usability issues related to the prototype’s visual design and interaction flow, and to uncover opportunities for improvement by observing how users interacted with key features.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Testing objectives:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Evaluate data comprehension: Assesss whether users can understand the health metrics presented in the dashboard.</li>
              <li>Test meal tracking usability: Observe how easily users can log meals, find saved items and interpret calorie information.</li>
              <li>Identify navigation challenges: Determine if users can intuitively move between key sections of the app.</li>
              <li>Uncover opportunities for improvement: Gather feedback on pain points, unclear elements, or missing features that could enhance the overall user experience and engagement.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Addressing usability concerns and user recommendations</h3>
            <p>Here are some of the key findings from the usability testing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The meal tracking interface now features a dropdown menu, enabling users to access saved and previous meal logs more efficiently.</li>
              <li>In the Glucose Track chart, significant changes in glucose levels are not easily detectable because the color shift is too subtle; a more distinct color transition could improve immediate recognition and action.</li>
              <li>Icons have been added to the hypnogram chart to help users quickly recognize chart elements and meanings, supporting reduced cognitive load and faster interpretation.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Design challenges</h2>
        <!-- <p>Redesigned the smart ring dashboard to translate complex health metrics into clear, relatable insights through layered visualizations, simplified language, and personalized narratives, while enhancing the meal tracking experience.</p> -->
        <p>Each update addresses specific usability challenges such as vague glucose visualization, compressed meal lists, and unclear sleep data presentation by refining interface elements, optimizing visual hierarchy, and adding intuitive cues. The following sections describe the reasoning and impact behind each redesign, highlighting improvements that make health tracking more accessible and actionable.</p>
        <!-- <img class="ultrahuman-screen" src="../assets/overview-screen.png" alt="overview screen"> -->
                
        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Redesigning Glucose Insights for Clarity and Behavior Awareness</h3>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The date picker is not visually clear, making it hard for users to know what they are selecting. The chart also feels vague, there is no distinct line connecting the data points to the end of the graph, which makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, the “food track line” that appears when users change their behavior is barely noticeable, since the color does not shift enough to signal a change.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To improve clarity and engagement, I redesign the date picker for better visibility, refine the chart with clearer data lines and anchors, and enhance the behavior-change indicator by introducing dynamic color shifts that make progress instantly recognizable.</p>
          <img class="ultrahuman-screen" src="../assets/dashboard-redesign.png" alt="glucose-screen">
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Streamlining Meal Tracking for Better Readability and Smarter Recall</h3>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The list of past meals appears overly compressed, with too much information packed into a limited space, making it hard to read and match quantities to the correct items. Additionally, the tracked items seem to be displayed in no particular order, leaving users unsure whether they rre seeing the most frequent or most recent entries first.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> In the updated design, meal items are now displayed individually, with calories and quantities presented in a clearer, more readable format. A new section for saving custom meals has been added at the top for quicker access. These saved meals appear first, followed by the most frequently tracked items. Each saved meal also shows the total calorie count for every food item it includes.</p>

          <h3>Visualizing Macronutrients for Instant Nutritional Understanding</h3>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The macronutrient doughnut graph is difficult to interpret.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The macronutrients are displayed in a separate doughnut graph, which makes it clear to understand how the total number of calories in the item is split between each macronutrient.</p>
          <img src="" alt="macronutrients-screen">
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h3>Making Sleep Data Intuitive Through Smarter Charts and Visual Hierarchy</h3>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The sleep stages section lacks visual clarity, making it difficult for users  to interpret their sleep patterns. Both the hypnogram and sleep score charts have room for improvement in terms of readability and data storytelling.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Enhanced the visual hierarchy and labeling within the sleep stages section, redesign the hypnogram to better differentiate bed time and wake up time, and refine the sleep score chart with clearer indicators and contextual cues to help users quickly grasp their sleep quality.</p>
