                <p>
                    GymPro is a modern gym, developed to
                    serve high-end clients, including services such as
                    gym, spa, swimming pool, minibar and restaurants, personal

                <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that it is a gym with high end technology,
                    it became obvious that the member control was not
                    up to the expected stantard. Customers were complaining about it and about its lack of usability. The intent of the company is also to sell online gym products, however it was not clear how they would be able to achieve this given the current design.
                    How can we control members (registration, management), member portal and online store?

            <h3>Lean UX Canvas</h3>
            <p>I started the discovery phase of my process with the Lean UX canvas. This tool helped me proritize user needs over feature development, leading to a more user-centric solutions.
            </p>

            <h3>User research</h3>
            <p>I conducted a mix of qualitative and quantitative questions in order to understand the perceptions, preferences and behaviors of users. It will help me make informed decisions to improve my product service.</p>
            <p>I interviewed 5 individuals who are high-income professionals, athletes or sports enthusiasts, luxury seekers that went to gympro or their competitor in the last 6 months.</p>
            <p>Below are some insights and highligths</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall satisfaction: 66% like the overall experience but is concern about the app usability </li>
                <li>likelihood to recommended:" 66%</li>
                <li>class information: 40%</li>
                <li>online store: 40% want to buy online from the product brand</li>
                <li>Personalized recommendations: 28%</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interviews</h3>
            <p>The information I  gathered during the interview is critial for validating or refuting the assumptions and helped guiding the development of the product</p>

              <p>Utilizing the affinity maapping technique, I organize quotes and discovered themes across each interview. Helping to create the personas later on.</p>

            <p>Persona is a tool that represents a group of target users and is created based on research data. Creating 2 personas helps to understand of what the users are looking for.</p>
            <p>The primary persona is Jarvah the high-income client. He goes to the gym almost every day, however he finds hard to make better use of all services offered because the app is not user friendly.</p>
            <p>The secondary persona is Rachel, is a sport enthusiast, who find it hard to coordanate class, recovery in the SPA and also wants to find her suppliments and gear sports in one realiable place.</p>

            <h3>How Might We</h3>
            <p>HMW is a design thinking activity used to translate problems into opportunites for design.</p>
            <p>The plan is to generate as many as questions to validate and find out insights.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>HMW improve the usability of the GymPro member portal to enhance user satisfaction and engagement?</li>
              <li>HMW create a centralized booking system within the GymPro portal to simplify the scheduling process for members?</li>
              <li>HMW provide detailed class information (e.g., instructor bios, class description) in the GymPro member portal to help members make informed decisions about their fitness activities?</li>
              <li>HMW integrate personalized recommendations into the GymPro portal?</li>
              <li>HMW develop an integrated online store within the GymPro portal to offer exclusive branded products, items, and accessories to members?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Customer Journey Map</h3>
            <p>Using Customer Journey Map I recreated a user’s behavior when navigating through GymPro app. I found lots of opportunities.</p>
            <div>
              <p>Persona: Jarvah</p>
              <p>Scenario: Jarvah, a 38-year-old successful corporate executive with a high annual income. Jarvah values efficiency, quality, and exclusivity in all his activities. He has a busy schedule and prioritizes health and fitness, making him a regular at GymPro. He enjoys using high-tech solutions that save time and enhance his lifestyle.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>GymPro's current member portal is not meeting the expectations of its luxury-seeking, high-income and sport enthusiasts clientele. The portal's poor usability, lack of centralized booking, and insufficient class information are significant pain points for members. These issues are causing frustration, reducing the frequency of portal usage, and negatively impacting overall member satisfaction and engagement with GymPro's services.</p>

            <p>Based on the information gathered during the research and persona phase, I was able to decide the main categories of my app. Hence, I performed a <span class="card-sorting-description">closed card sorting</span> to understand which feature fits best under which category.</p>
