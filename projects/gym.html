                <p>
                    Despite the fact that it is a gym with high end technology,
                    it became obvious that the member control was not
                    up to the expected stantard. Customers were complaining about it and about its lack of usability. The intent of the company is also to sell online gym products, however it was not clear how they would be able to achieve this given the current design.
                    How can we control members (registration, management), member portal and online store?
