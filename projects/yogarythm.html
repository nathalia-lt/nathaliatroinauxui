                     Yoga is a great way to deal with stress relief in the form of a physical workout. I want to create an intuitive and interactive Yoga app that can help begginers to learn and also find online classes. Effectiveness will be measured by analyzing the number of videos streamed as well as number of users accessing the site.

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>To understnd the needs and goals of my target users, I conducted user research using a combination of methods such as interviews and competitive analysis. </p>
                <h3>User interview</h3>
                <p>I conducted online and in person interviews, to understand how the users feel, their needs and their motivations. I wanted to get more insights into their frustations, goals and what need to happen to improve the website.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I interviewed 5 individuals, age 21 - 50, who have a busy schedule life, begginers and aware of the benefits of yoga.</p>

                    <li>Users are experiencing a lack of guidance to choose their classes</li>

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>Next, I wanted to explore more the functionality and beneficts that are offered by platforms offering a similar kind of product. I compared a couple of important components of UI and product in general to discover the areas where Yogarythm experience could improve.</p>
