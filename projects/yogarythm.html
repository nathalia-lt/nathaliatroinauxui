            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
              An article from Sarvodaya Hospital says that Yoga has become one
              of the fastest-growing wellness practices in the past dacade.
              Worldwilde, approximately 300 million people regulary practice
              Yoga. In the past 5 years alone, yoga practitioners in the US has
              increased by over 50%.
            </p>

            <h3>GOAL</h3>
            <p>
              Yoga is a great way to deal with stress relief in the form of a
              physical workout. I want to create an intuitive and interactive
              Yoga app that can help begginers to learn and also find online
              classes. Effectiveness will be measured by analyzing the number of
              videos streamed as well as number of users accessing the site.

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          I have used the Design Thinking approch for this case to ensure the
          app is user-centered. The desgin thinking framework involves the
          following phases:

      <section class="background-colored">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          To understand the needs and goals of my target users, I conducted user
          research using a combination of methods such as interviews and
          competitive analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>User interview</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted online and in person interviews, to understand how the
          users feel, their needs and their motivations. I wanted to get more
          insights into their frustations, goals and what need to happen to
          improve the website.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I interviewed 5 individuals, age 21 - 50, who have a busy schedule
          life, begginers and aware of the benefits of yoga.
        </p>
        <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
        <p>Emily Hacker, 33, teacher, lives in California</p>
        <img
          class="emphaty-map"
          src="../assets/emphaty-map.png"
          alt="emphaty-map"
        />
        <p>The empathy map allowed me to identify the user pain points</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User wants to be able to choose the teacher</li>
          <li>Users are experiencing a lack of information on postures</li>
          <li>User want a platform to learn from home</li>
          <li>
            Users are experiencing a lack of guidance to choose their classes
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Next, I wanted to explore more the functionality and beneficts that
          are offered by platforms offering a similar kind of product. I
          compared a couple of important components of UI and product in general
          to discover the areas where Yogarythm experience could improve.

        <p>
          Based on the feedback from initial usability test and insights, I
          created hi-fi wireframes and a prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          User testing revealed a list of priority revisions that I implemented
          to the high-fidelity prototype that included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>User want more information about the teachers background</li>
          <li>User want a free option membership</li>
          <li>
            Added a CTA in the membership section to encourage the user to
            select a plan
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          I thoroughly enjoyed learning and experiencing throughout the entire
          process. Navigating through challenges was essential, from the initial
          research phase where I aimed to gain clarity on user frustrations,
          needs, and desires, to figuring out the appropriate features for the
          app. For this project, I also decided to develop the landing page and
          apply my knowledge in HTML and CSS. I believe that speaking the
          language of developers makes collaboration smoother and more
          efficient.
        </p>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          As I continue gaining more experience in UX field, I would like to
          revisit this project in the future and try out new things to improve
          the overall design.
