                          <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                          <p>What amount of waste did you generate today? Perhaps a plastic bottle, some fruit peels, or a yogurt container? Have you recycled it? Are you sure that the waste was disposed of in the correct bin?</p>
                        </br>
                          <p>
                            An aritcle from rePurpose website says: "Only about 9% of plastic is recycled, while the remaining 91% is either landfilled, incinerated, or dumped into the environment. Since the 1950s, humans have produced over 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic, and almost every piece still exists in some form."
                            And that is about plastic, one of the easiest materials to know how to recycle.

                        <p>Before jumping straight into research or solutions we decide to do a CSD Matrix to discuss, prioritize, and plan activities, track research progress, and surface remaning doubts using specific prompts for each category. The goal of this activity is not to reach consensus but gather and organize information from diverse perspectives.</p>
